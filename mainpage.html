	<br>  <h2>though he's fallen into partial obscurity in the nine years since his death, </h2>
	<section> <p> Aaron Swartz remains a hugely influential figure in digital cultural heritage. Initially recognized for his groundbreaking contributions in computer programming and software development, Swartz's tireless committment to activism eventually resulted in a high-profile federal trial when he attempted to download and make publicly available $50,000 worth of intellectual property from J-STOR. He was also a tireless reader, thinker, and emergent critic of digial culture.</p>
		<p> In the time since his trial and subsequent death, the Internet has only become more privatized, and trends away from the open access principles upon which it was founded. This website serves as a reminder of Swartz's imaginative conceptions for what the Internet could (and still can) be, and a reminder of the principles of open access.</p>
